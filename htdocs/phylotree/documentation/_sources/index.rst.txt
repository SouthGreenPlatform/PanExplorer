Welcome to Phylotree.js's documentation!
========================================

Phylotree.js is a Javascript library for working with phylogenetic trees. Uses include web application development and interactive data visualization for phylogenetics.

It is written as a `D3`_ layout, and aspires to be a general purpose tool for visualizing and selecting branches in phylogenetic trees. Example uses include `a standalone web application`_ for viewing and labeling phylogenetic trees, the `Datamonkey`_ webserver for comparative sequence analysis, an `ancestral sequence structural viewer`_, and an `interactive tanglegram`_.

The code is `available on Github`_.
